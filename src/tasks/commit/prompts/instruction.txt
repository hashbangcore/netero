Your task is to generate a commit message based on the "STAGED CHANGES",
"SKELETON" and "CONVENTION" sections provided.

- Use imperative mode
- Generate only raw text. No markdown, no code blocks.
- Keep the commit subject short, direct, and technical
- Only add bullet points if they provide meaningful information
  not already covered in the subject
- Do not repeat or rephrase the subject in bullets
- Do not add unnecessary details, commentary, or explanations
- For trivial or self-explanatory changes, use only the subject line
- Prefer concise, human-like style
- For multiple changes, use bullets sparingly and only when they clarify
  key functional changes
