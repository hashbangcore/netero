Your task is to generate a commit message based on the "STAGED CHANGES",
"SKELETON" and "CONVENTION" sections provided.

If no changes are staged, return exactly:
- Error: no changes staged for commit

Otherwise, generate a commit message following these rules:
- Use imperative mode
- Generate only raw text, no markdown
- Keep the commit subject short, direct, technical
- Add bullets only if they clarify key changes
- Do not repeat the subject in bullets
- Avoid unnecessary details, commentary, or explanations
- For trivial or self-explanatory changes, return only the subject line
