Your task is to generate a conventional commit message based on the "STAGED CHANGES" provided.
1. Use the IMPERATIVE mood (e.g., "fix bug" not "fixed bug").
2. The first line (subject) MUST NOT exceed 50 characters.
3. The body MUST be wrapped at exactly 50 characters per line.
4. Focus on the "WHY" and "WHAT", not the literal "I removed this line".
5. Generate ONLY the raw text. No markdown, no "Sure, here is...", no code blocks.
